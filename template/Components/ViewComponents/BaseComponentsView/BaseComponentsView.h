/**
 * Base class of all view components. It basically loads the nib using the 
 * class name or using the method `nibName` (which can be implemented in case
 * your component doesn't have a xib). Then it adds the loaded nib as a subview
 * (using constraints) of the view
 * Pay attention to this: the component class (which inherits from BaseComponentsView)
 * is actually the superview of its nib.
